[{"User":"TwosomesUP","Address":"0x000000","Note":"======================================================\r\nNotes on Data Structures\r\n======================================================\r\n\r\nAll entities (boss, character, enemey, etc) use a base entity structure to store their base data (health, spirit, money, attribute) with consistent offsets. More complex entities like the player character or bosses will contain additional data with unique offsets to that entity type.\r\n\r\nAll entities in a level will be contained within the Level Data structure. For the most part offsets to these entities are consistent but in some levels it can be variable.\r\n\r\nLevel data can also contain non-Entity data. Offsets for this data can vary based on the current level.\r\n\r\nCode notes for each known entity in each level can be found below as well as their offset from that level's Level Data structure. This is primarily for ease of access while testing and\/or troubleshooting.\r\n\r\n======================================================\r\nEntity Structures\r\n======================================================\r\n\r\n== Base Entity ==\r\n+d4 = Health [16-bit]\r\n\r\n+d8 = Spirit [16-bit]\r\n\r\n+e0 = Attribute [8-bit]\r\nvalue = 00: Normal\r\nvalue = 01: Mirage\r\nvalue = 02: Silhouette\r\n\r\n+e4 = Money [16-bit]\r\n\r\n== Player Entity ==\r\n+2a = Parasite Bomb Timer [8-bit]\r\nvalue > 0: Active\r\n\r\n+4c = Player State\r\nvalue = 02: Dashing\r\nvalue = 03: Sliding\r\nvalue = 05: In Air\/Falling\r\nvalue = 07: Knocked Back\r\nvalue = 08: Damaged\r\nvalue = 18: Parasite Bomb\r\nvalue = 1a: Crouching\r\nvalue = 1b: Crouch Dashing\r\nvalue = 1c: Reflector Shield Up\r\nvalue = 1d: Holding Enemy\r\n\r\n+b0 = Held Enemy State [8-bit]\r\nvalue = 10: Holding Enemy\r\n\r\n+b4 = Held Enemy Pointer [32-bit]\r\n\r\n+107 = Jump Counter [8-bit]\r\n- Set to 2 after initial jump\r\n- Decremented by 1 after each subsequent midair jump\r\n- When 0 and airborn, no more jumps remaining\r\n\r\n+14c = Attribute State [8-bit]\r\nvalue = 00: Normal\r\nvalue = 01: Inversed\r\n\r\n======================================================\r\nNon-Entity Level Data\r\n======================================================\r\n\r\n== Selected Shop Item ==\r\nStandard shops will top off at 09 but special shops will top off at 24.
